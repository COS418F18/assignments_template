	// You can find the filename for this map task's input to reduce task number
	// r using reduceName(jobName, mapTaskNumber, r). The ihash function (given
	// below doMap) should be used to decide which file a given key belongs into.

	// The intermediate output of a map task is stored in the file
	// system as multiple files whose name indicates which map task produced
	// them, as well as which reduce task they are for. Coming up with a
	// scheme for how to store the key/value pairs on disk can be tricky,
	// especially when taking into account that both keys and values could
	// contain newlines, quotes, and any other character you can think of.
	//
	// One format often used for serializing data to a byte stream that the
	// other end can correctly reconstruct is JSON. You are not required to
	// use JSON, but as the output of the reduce tasks *must* be JSON,
	// familiarizing yourself with it here may prove useful. You can write
	// out a data structure as a JSON string to a file using the commented
	// code below. The corresponding decoding functions can be found in
	// common_reduce.go.
	//
	//   enc := json.NewEncoder(file)
	//   for _, kv := ... {
	//     err := enc.Encode(&kv)
	//
	// Remember to close the file after you have written all the values!
	// Use checkError to handle errors.
