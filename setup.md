# COS418 Assignment Setup

### Go Installation

You will need a working Go environment for the assignments. 
Your version should be at least Go 1.9, which is the version that Grading scripts will use.
The latest version as of the Fall 2018 semester is Go 1.11. Things work in 1.9 should also work in 1.11. Learn more about semantic of versioning [here](https://semver.org/).

<h3>Cycles (Pre-installed)</h3>
<p>
  The CS servers (cycles.cs.princeton.edu) are one option, if you have a <a href="https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/accounts">CS account</a>.
<pre>
spin:~$ which go
/usr/bin/go
@spin:~$ go version
go version go1.6.3 linux/amd64</pre>
  We have tested that all the infrastructure for the course works on these machines.
</p>

<h3>Courselab (Pre-installed)</h3>
<p>
The <a href="https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/resources/courselab">Courselab</a> servers (courselab.cs.princeton.edu), using your
<a href="https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/accounts/oitnetid">Princeton netId</a>.
<pre>
courselab:~$ which go
/usr/bin/go
courselab:~$ go version
go version go1.8.3 linux/amd64</pre>

We only support the above methods for using Go. For help with courselab servers see <a href="https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/resources/courselab">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Manual for Various OSes</h3>
<p>
  Another option is to install Go on your own machine manually. There are instructions to install from source or with a 
  package installer for several operating systems at Google's Go site: <a href="https://golang.org/dl/">golang.org</a>.
</p>

<h3>Via Package Manager for OS X</h3>
<p>
  Finally, for Macs many people use package management software, the two most common of which are 
  <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and 
  <a href="https://guide.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> 
  (these links include installation instructions for the package managers themselves). 
  Here is a walkthrough of installing Go using each of these:
<pre>
dustpuppy:~$ brew --version
0.9.5
dustpuppy:~$ go
-bash: go: command not found
dustpuppy:~$ brew install go
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/go-1.7.1.el_capitan.bottle.
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring go-1.7.1.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
As of go 1.2, a valid GOPATH is required to use the `go get` command:
  https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

You may wish to add the GOROOT-based install location to your PATH:
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/go/libexec/bin
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/go/1.7.1: 6,436 files, 250.6M
dustpuppy:~$ go version
go version go1.7.1 darwin/amd64</pre>
NB: if <tt>brew install go</tt> attempts to install an ancient version (e.g. 1.3) you will have to do <tt>brew update</tt> first to refresh your list of packages that Homebrew knows about.
<pre>
dustpuppy:~$ port version
Version: 2.3.4
dustpuppy:~$ go
-bash: go: command not found
dustpuppy:~$ sudo port install go

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
 There are many commonly used tools in the Go ecosystem. The three most useful starting out are:
 <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">Go fmt</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/vet/">Go vet</a>, which are built-ins, and <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint">Golint</a>, which is similar to the <tt>splint</tt> tool you used in COS217. 
</p>

<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>
 For those of you in touch with your systems side (this <em>is</em> Distributed Systems, after all), there are quite a few resources for Go development in both <a href="https://github.com/dominikh/go-mode.el">emacs</a> (additional information available <a href="http://dominik.honnef.co/posts/2013/03/emacs-go-1/">here</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go">vim</a> (additional resources <a href="http://farazdagi.com/blog/2015/vim-as-golang-ide/">here</a>).
</p>

<p>
 As many Princeton COS students have become attached to Sublime, here are the two indispensible Sublime packages for Go development: <a href="https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime">GoSublime</a> and <a href="https://github.com/golang/sublime-build">Sublime-Build</a>. And -- learning from the ancient emacs-vi holy war -- it would be inviting trouble to offer Sublime information without likewise dispensing the must-have Atom plugin: <a href="https://atom.io/packages/go-plus">Go-Plus</a> (walkthrough and additional info <a href="https://rominirani.com/setup-go-development-environment-with-atom-editor-a87a12366fcf#.v49dtbadi">here</a>).
