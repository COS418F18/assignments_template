# COS418 Assignment 1 (Part 3): Distributed Map/Reduce

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Part c continues the work from assignment 1.2 &mdash; building a Map/Reduce
  library as a way to learn the Go programming language and as a way to learn
  about fault tolerance in distributed systems. In this part of the assignment, you will
  tackle a distributed version of the Map/Reduce library, writing code for a master
  that hands out tasks to multiple workers and handles failures in workers.
  The interface to the library and the approach to fault tolerance is similar to the one described in
  the original
  <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce paper</a>.
  As with the previous part of this assignment, you will also complete a sample Map/Reduce application.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
  You will use the same mapreduce package as in part b, focusing this time on the distributed mode.
</p>

<p>
  Over the course of this assignment, you will have to
  modify <tt>schedule</tt> from  <tt>schedule.go</tt>, as well
  as <tt>mapF</tt> and <tt>reduceF</tt> in <tt>main/ii.go</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  As with the previous part of this assignment, you should not need to modify any other files, but reading them
  might be useful in order to understand how the other methods
  fit into the overall architecture of the system.
</p>

To get start, copy all source files from `assignment1-2/src` to `assignment1-3/src`

<pre>
# start from your 418 GitHub repo
$ cd 418
$ ls
README.md     assignment1-1 assignment1-2 assignment1-3 assignment2   assignment3   assignment4   assignment5   setup.md
$ cp -r assignment1-2/src/* assignment1-3/src/
$ ls assignment1-3/src
main      mapreduce
</pre>

<h2>Part I: Distributing MapReduce tasks</h2>

<p>
  One of Map/Reduce's biggest selling points is that the
  developer should not need to be aware that their code is
  running in parallel on many machines. In theory, we should be
  able to take the word count code you wrote in Part II of assignment 1.2, and
  automatically parallelize it!
</p>

<p>
  Our current implementation runs all the map and reduce tasks one
  after another on the master. While this is conceptually simple,
  it is not great for performance. In this part of the assignment, you
  will complete a version of MapReduce that splits the work up
  over a set of worker threads, in order to exploit multiple
  cores. Computing the map tasks in parallel and then the reduce tasks can
  result in much faster completion, but is also harder to implement and debug.
  Note that for this part of the assignment, the work is not distributed across multiple
  machines as in &ldquo;real&rdquo; Map/Reduce deployments, your
  implementation will be using RPC and channels to simulate a
  truly distributed computation.
</p>

<p>
  To coordinate the parallel execution of tasks, we will use a
  special master thread, which hands out work to the workers and
  waits for them to finish. To make the assignment more realistic, the
  master should only communicate with the workers via RPC. We
  give you the worker code (<tt>mapreduce/worker.go</tt>), the
  code that starts the workers, and code to deal with RPC
  messages (<tt>mapreduce/common_rpc.go</tt>).
</p>

<p>
  Your job is to complete <tt>schedule.go</tt> in the
  <tt>mapreduce</tt> package. In particular, you should modify
  <tt>schedule()</tt> in <tt>schedule.go</tt> to hand out the map
  and reduce tasks to workers, and return only when all the tasks
  have finished.
</p>

<p>
  Look at <tt>run()</tt> in <tt>master.go</tt>. It calls
  your <tt>schedule()</tt> to run the map and reduce tasks, then
  calls <tt>merge()</tt> to assemble the per-reduce-task outputs
  into a single output file. <tt>schedule</tt> only needs to tell
  the workers the name of the original input file
  (<tt>mr.files[task]</tt>) and the task <tt>task</tt>; each worker
  knows from which files to read its input and to which files to
  write its output. The master tells the worker about a new task
  by sending it the RPC call <tt>Worker.DoTask</tt>, giving a
  <tt>DoTaskArgs</tt> object as the RPC argument.
</p>

<p>
  When a worker starts, it sends a Register RPC to the master.
  <tt>master.go</tt> already implements the master's
  <tt>Master.Register</tt> RPC handler for you, and passes the
  new worker's information to <tt>mr.registerChannel</tt>.  Your
  <tt>schedule</tt> should process new worker registrations by
  reading from this channel.
</p>

<p>
  Information about the currently running job is in the
  <tt>Master</tt> struct, defined in <tt>master.go</tt>. Note
  that the master does not need to know which Map or Reduce
  functions are being used for the job; the workers will take
  care of executing the right code for Map or Reduce (the correct
  functions are given to them when they are started by
  <tt>main/wc.go</tt>).
</p>

<p>
  To test your solution, you should use the same Go test suite as
  you did in Part I of assignment 1.2, except swapping out <tt>-run Sequential</tt>
  with <tt>-run TestBasic</tt>. This will execute the distributed
  test case without worker failures instead of the sequential
  ones we were running before:
  <pre>$ go test -run TestBasic mapreduce/...</pre>
  As before, you can get more verbose output for debugging if you
  set <tt>debugEnabled = true</tt> in <tt>mapreduce/common.go</tt>, and add
  <tt>-v</tt> to the test command above. You will get much more
  output along the lines of:
<pre>
$ go test -v -run TestBasic mapreduce/...

<h2>Part II: Handling worker failures</h2>

<p>
  In this part you will make the master handle failed workers.
  MapReduce makes this relatively easy because workers don't have
  persistent state.  If a worker fails, any RPCs that the master
  issued to that worker will fail (e.g., due to a timeout).
  Thus, if the master's RPC to the worker fails, the master
  should re-assign the task given to the failed worker to another
  worker.
</p>

<p>
  An RPC failure doesn't necessarily mean that the worker failed;
  the worker may just be unreachable but still computing. Thus,
  it may happen that two workers receive the same task and compute
  it. However, because tasks are idempotent, it doesn't matter if
  the same task is computed twice &mdash; both times it will
  generate the same output. So, you don't have to do anything
  special for this case. (Our tests never fail workers in the
  middle of task, so you don't even have to worry about several
  workers writing to the same output file.)
</p>

<p class="note">
  You don't have to handle failures of the master; we will assume
  it won't fail. Making the master fault-tolerant is more
  difficult because it keeps persistent state that would have to
  be recovered in order to resume operations after a master
  failure. Much of the rest of this course is devoted to this challenge.
</p>

<p>
  Your implementation must pass the two remaining test cases in
  <tt>test_test.go</tt>. The first case tests the failure of one
  worker, while the second test case tests handling of many
  failures of workers. Periodically, the test cases start new
  workers that the master can use to make forward progress, but
  these workers fail after handling a few tasks. To run these
  tests:
  <pre>$ go test -run Failure mapreduce/...</pre>
</p>


<h2>Part III: Inverted index generation</h2>
<p>
  Word count is a classical example of a Map/Reduce
  application, but it is not an application that many
  large consumers of Map/Reduce use. It is simply not
  very often you need to count the words in a really
  large dataset. For this application exercise, we will
  instead have you build Map and Reduce functions for
  generating an <em>inverted index</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Inverted indices are widely used in computer science,
  and are particularly useful in document searching.
  Broadly speaking, an inverted index is a map from
  interesting facts about the underlying data, to the
  original location of that data. For example, in the
  context of search, it might be a map from keywords to
  documents that contain those words.
</p>

<p>
  We have created a second binary in <tt>main/ii.go</tt>
  that is very similar to the <tt>wc.go</tt> you built
  earlier. You should modify <tt>mapF</tt> and
  <tt>reduceF</tt> in <tt>main/ii.go</tt> so that they
  together produce an inverted index. Running
  <tt>ii.go</tt> should output a list of tuples, one per
  line, in the following format:
<pre>
$ go run ii.go master sequential pg-*.txt
$ head -n5 mrtmp.iiseq
A: 16 pg-being_ernest.txt,pg-dorian_gray.txt,pg-dracula.txt,pg-emma.txt,pg-frankenstein.txt,pg-great_expectations.txt,pg-grimm.txt,pg-huckleberry_finn.txt,pg-les_miserables.txt,pg-metamorphosis.txt,pg-moby_dick.txt,pg-sherlock_holmes.txt,pg-tale_of_two_cities.txt,pg-tom_sawyer.txt,pg-ulysses.txt,pg-war_and_peace.txt
ABC: 2 pg-les_miserables.txt,pg-war_and_peace.txt
ABOUT: 2 pg-moby_dick.txt,pg-tom_sawyer.txt
ABRAHAM: 1 pg-dracula.txt
ABSOLUTE: 1 pg-les_miserables.txt</pre>

If it is not clear from the listing above, the format is:
<pre>word: #documents documents,sorted,and,separated,by,commas</pre>
</p>

<p>
  We will test your implementation's correctness with the following command, which should produce these resulting last 10 items in the index:
<pre>
$ sort -k1,1 mrtmp.iiseq | sort -snk2,2 mrtmp.iiseq | grep -v '16' | tail -10

<h2>Resources and Advice</h2>
<ul class="hints">
  <li>
    The master should send RPCs to the workers in
    parallel so that the workers can work on tasks
    concurrently.  You will find the <tt>go</tt>
    statement useful for this purpose and the
    <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/">Go RPC documentation</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The master may have to wait for a worker to
    finish before it can hand out more tasks. You
    may find channels useful to synchronize threads
    that are waiting for reply with the master once
    the reply arrives. Channels are explained in
    the document on
    <a href="http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency">Concurrency in Go</a>.
  </li>

  <li>
    The code we give you runs the workers as threads within a
    single UNIX process, and can exploit multiple cores on a single
    machine. Some modifications would be needed in order to run the
    workers on multiple machines communicating over a network. The
    RPCs would have to use TCP rather than UNIX-domain sockets;
    there would need to be a way to start worker processes on all
    the machines; and all the machines would have to share storage
    through some kind of network file system.
  </li>

  <li>
    The easiest way to track down bugs is to insert
    <tt>debug()</tt> statements, set <tt>debugEngabled = true</tt> in <tt>mapreduce/common.go</tt>,
    collect the output in a file with, e.g.,
    <tt>go test -run TestBasic mapreduce/... &gt; out</tt>,
    and then think about whether the output matches
    your understanding of how your code should
    behave. The last step (thinking) is the most
    important.
  </li>

  <li>
    When you run your code, you may receive many errors like <tt>method has wrong number of ins</tt>. You can ignore all of these as long as your tests pass.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>

You hand in your assignment as before.

```bash
$ git commit -am "[you fill me in]"
$ git tag -a -m "i finished assignment 1-3" a13-handin
$ git push origin master
$ git push origin a13-handin
$
```

You should verify that you are able to see your final commit and tags
on the Github page of your repository for this assignment.

<p>
  You will receive full credit for Part I if your software passes
  <tt>TestBasic</tt> from <tt>test_test.go</tt> (the test given in Part I) on the CS servers.
  You will receive full credit for Part II if your software passes the tests with worker failures (the <tt>Failure</tt> pattern to <tt>go test</tt> given in Part II) on the CS servers.
  You will receive full credit for Part II if your index output matches the correct output when run on the CS servers.
</p>

<p>
  The final portion of your credit is determined by code quality tests, using the standard tools <tt>gofmt</tt> and <tt>go vet</tt>.
  You will receive full credit for this portion if all files submitted conform to the style standards set by <tt>gofmt</tt> and the report from <tt>go vet</tt> is clean for your mapreduce package (that is, produces no errors).
  If your code does not pass the <tt>gofmt</tt> test, you should reformat your code using the tool. You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/qiniu/checkstyle">Go Checkstyle</a> tool for advice to improve your code's style, if applicable.  Additionally, though not part of the graded cheks, it would also be advisable to produce code that complies with <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint">Golint</a> where possible.
